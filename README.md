AtliQ Business Insights 360 Project Overview-->

AltiQ Hardware, a fast-growing company expanding globally, specializes in selling computers and accessories through three main channels: retailers, direct sales, and distributors.

Despite its growth, the company faced unexpected losses after opening a store in America. These setbacks were identified through surveys, intuition, and basic Excel analysis. With competitors boasting robust analytics teams, AltiQ Hardware recognizes the urgent need to develop its analytics capabilities to thrive in the industry.

To surpass competitors and enable data-driven decision-making, the company has decided to implement Power BI for analytics. This project aims to provide stakeholders with insights into finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain, ensuring informed decisions at all levels.
